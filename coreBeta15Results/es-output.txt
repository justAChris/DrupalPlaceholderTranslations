<em>Simple actions</em> do not require configuration and are listed automatically as available on the <a href="!actions">Actions page</a>.
<em>Advanced actions</em> are user-created and have to be configured individually. Create an advanced action on the <a href="!actions">Actions page</a> by selecting an action type from the drop-down list. Then configure your action, for example by specifying the recipient of an automated email message.
The Aggregator module is an on-site syndicator and news reader that gathers and displays fresh content from RSS-, RDF-, and Atom-based feeds made available across the web. Thousands of sites (particularly news sites and blogs) publish their latest headlines in feeds, using a number of standardized XML-based formats. For more information, see the <a href="!aggregator-module">online documentation for the Aggregator module</a>.
Users view feed content in the <a href="!aggregator">main aggregator display</a>, or by <a href="!aggregator-sources">their source</a> (usually via an RSS feed reader). The most recent content in a feed can be displayed as a block through the <a href="!admin-block">Blocks administration page</a>.
A <a href="!aggregator-opml">machine-readable OPML file</a> of all feeds is available. OPML is an XML-based file format used to share outline-structured information such as a list of RSS feeds. Feeds can also be <a href="!import-opml">imported via an OPML file</a>.
A working <a href="!cron">cron maintenance task</a> is required to update feeds automatically.
Current feeds are listed below, and <a href="!addfeed">new feeds may be added</a>. For each feed, the <em>latest items</em> block may be enabled at the <a href="!block">blocks administration page</a>.
The Ban module allows administrators to ban visits to their site from individual IP addresses. For more information, see <a href="!url">the online documentation for the Ban module</a>.
Administrators can enter IP addresses to ban on the <a href="!bans">IP address bans</a> page.
To change the settings of an individual block click on the <em>Configure</em> link on the <a href="!blocks">Block layout page</a>. The available options vary depending on the module that provides the block. For all blocks you can change the block title and toggle whether to display it.
The outline feature allows you to include pages in the <a href="!book">Book hierarchy</a>, as well as move them within the hierarchy or to <a href="!book-admin">reorder an entire book</a>.
CKEditor has to be enabled and configured separately for individual text formats from the <a href="!formats">Text formats and editors page</a> because the filter settings for each text format can be different. For more information, see the <a href="!text_editor">Text Editor help page</a> and <a href="!filter">Filter help page</a>.
CKEditor only allow users to format content in accordance with the filter configuration of the specific text format. If a text format excludes certain HTML tags, the corresponding toolbar buttons are not displayed to users when they edit a text field in this format. For more information see the <a href="!filter">Filter help page</a>.
The Comment module allows users to comment on site content, set commenting defaults and permissions, and moderate comments. For more information, see the <a href="!comment">online documentation for the Comment module</a>.
Comments from users who have the <em>Skip comment approval</em> permission are published immediately. All other comments are placed in the <a href="!comment-approval">Unapproved comments</a> queue, until a user who has permission to <em>Administer comments and comment settings</em> publishes or deletes them. Published comments can be bulk managed on the <a href="!admin-comment">Published comments</a> administration page. When a comment has no replies, it remains editable by its author, as long as the author has <em>Edit own comments</em> permission.
The Configuration Translation module allows you to translate configuration text; for example, the site name, vocabularies, menus, or date formats. Together with the modules <a href="!language">Language</a>, <a href="!content-translation">Content Translation</a>, and <a href="!locale">Interface Translation</a>, it allows you to build multilingual websites. For more information, see the <a href="!doc_url">online documentation for the Configuration Translation module</a>.
In order to translate configuration, the website must have at least two <a href="!url">languages</a>.
Users with the <em>Translate user edited configuration</em> permission can access the configuration translation overview, and manage translations for specific languages. The <a href="!translation-page">Configuration translation</a> page shows a list of all configuration text that can be translated, either as individual items or as lists. After you click on <em>Translate</em>, you are provided with a list of all languages. You can <em>add</em> or <em>edit</em> a translation for a specific language. Users with specific configuration permissions can also <em>edit</em> the text for the site's default language. For some configuration text items (for example for the site information), the specific translation pages can also be accessed directly from their configuration pages.
You can choose to translate date formats on the <a href="!translation-page">Configuration translation</a> page. This allows you not only to translate the label text, but also to set a language-specific <em>PHP date format</em>.
In order to translate content, the website must have at least two <a href="!url">languages</a>. When that is the case, you can enable translation for the desired content entities on the <a href="!translation-entity">Content language</a> page. When enabling translation you can choose the default language for content and decide whether to show the language selection field on the content editing forms.
Before you can translate content, there must be at least two languages added on the <a href="!url">languages administration</a> page.
The <em>settings</em> and the <em>display</em> of the Date field can be configured separately. See the <a href="!field_ui">Field UI help</a> for more information on how to manage fields and their display.
The Database Logging module logs system events in the Drupal database. For more information, see the online handbook entry for the <a href="!dblog">Database Logging module</a>.
The Database Logging module allows you to view an event log on the <a href="!dblog">Recent log messages</a> page. The log is a chronological list of recorded events containing usage data, performance data, errors, warnings and operational information. Administrators should check the log on a regular basis to ensure their site is working properly.
In case of errors or problems with the site, the <a href="!dblog">Recent log messages</a> page can be useful for debugging, since it shows the sequence of events. The log messages include usage information, warnings, and errors.
The Text Editor module provides a framework that other modules (such as <a href="!ckeditor">CKEditor module</a>) can use to provide toolbars and other functionality that allow users to format text more easily than typing HTML tags directly. For more information, see the <a href="!documentation">online documentation for the Text Editor module</a>.
The Text Editor module provides a framework for managing editors. To use it, you also need to enable a text editor. This can either be the core <a href="!ckeditor">CKEditor module</a>, which can be enabled on the <a href="!extend">Extend page</a>, or a contributed module for any other text editor. When installing a contributed text editor module, be sure to check the installation instructions, because you will most likely need to download and install an external library as well as the Drupal module.
On the <a href="!formats">Text formats and editors page</a> you can see which text editor is associated with each text format. You can change this by clicking on the <em>Configure</em> link, and then choosing a text editor or <em>none</em> from the <em>Text editor</em> drop-down list. The text editor will then be displayed with any text field for which this text format is chosen.
The <em>settings</em> and the <em>display</em> of the entity reference field can be configured separately. See the <a href="!field_ui">Field UI help</a> for more information on how to manage fields and their display.
The File module allows you to create fields that contain files. See the <a href="!field">Field module help</a> and the <a href="!field_ui">Field UI help</a> pages for general information on fields and how to create and manage them. For more information, see the <a href="!file_documentation">online documentation for the File module</a>.
The <em>settings</em> and the <em>display</em> of the file field can be configured separately. See the <a href="!field_ui">Field UI help</a> for more information on how to manage fields and their display.
Uploaded files can either be stored as <em>public</em> or <em>private</em>, depending on the <a href="!file-system">File system settings</a>. For more information, see the <a href="!system-help">System module help page</a>.
The Filter module allows administrators to configure text formats. Text formats define the HTML tags, codes, and other input allowed in text entered in the site and they defend your web site against potentially damaging input from malicious users. A visual text editor can be associated with the text formats by using the <a href="!editor_help">Text Editor module</a>. For more information, see <a href="!filter_do">the online documentation for the Filter module</a>.
You can create and edit text formats on the <a href="!formats">Text formats page</a> (if the Text Editor module is enabled, this page is named Text formats and editors). One text format is included by default: Plain text (which removes all HTML tags). Additional text formats may be created during installation. You can create a text format by clicking "<a href="!add_format">Add text format</a>".
Text formats define the HTML tags, code, and other formatting that can be used when entering text. <strong>Improper text format configuration is a security risk</strong>. Learn more on the <a href="@filterhelp">Filter module help page</a>.
For more information, see <a href="!forum">the online documentation for the Forum module</a>.
Visit the <a href="!forums">Forums page</a> to set up containers and forums to hold your discussion topics.
The <a href="!create-topic">Forum topic</a> link on the <a href="!content-add">Add content</a> page creates the first post of a new threaded discussion, or thread.
Enabling the Forum module provides a default <em>Forums</em> menu item in the Tools menu that links to the <a href="!forums">Forums page</a>.
Adjust the display of your forum topics. Organize the forums on the <a href="!forum-structure">forum structure page</a>.
<a href="!hal_spec">Hypertext Application Language (HAL)</a> is a format that supports the linking required for hypermedia APIs.
Hypermedia APIs are a style of Web API that uses URIs to identify resources and the <a href="!link_rel">link relations</a> between them, enabling API consumers to follow links to discover API functionality.
This module adds support for serializing entities (such as content items, taxonomy terms, etc.) to the JSON version of HAL. For more information, see <a href="!hal_do">the online documentation for the HAL module</a>.

The Help module displays explanations for using each module listed on the main <a href="!help">Help reference page</a>.
The History module keeps track of which content a user has read. It marks content as <em>new</em> or <em>updated</em> depending on the last time the user viewed it. History records that are older than one month are removed during cron, which means that content older than one month is always considered <em>read</em>. The History module does not have a user interface but it provides a filter to <a href="!views-help">Views</a> to show new or updated content. For more information, see the <a href="!url">online documentation for the History module</a>.
If the Block module is enabled, then you can add a language switcher block on the <a href="!blocks">Block layout</a> page to allow users to switch between languages.
If the Block module is enabled, then the Language module allows you to set the visibility of a block based on selected languages on the <a href="!blocks">Block layout</a> page.
The Link module allows you to create fields that contain internal or external URLs and optional link text. See the <a href="!field">Field module help</a> and the <a href="!field_ui">Field UI help</a> pages for general information on fields and how to create and manage them. For more information, see the <a href="!link_documentation">online documentation for the Link module</a>.
The <em>settings</em> and the <em>display</em> of the link field can be configured separately. See the <a href="!field_ui">Field UI help</a> for more information on how to manage fields and their display.
The Menu UI module provides an interface for managing menus. A menu is a hierarchical collection of links, which can be within or external to the site, generally used for navigation. For more information, see the <a href="!menu">online documentation for the Menu UI module</a>.
Users with the <em>Administer menus and menu items</em> permission can add, edit, and delete custom menus on the <a href="!menu">Menus page</a>. Custom menus can be special site menus, menus of external links, or any combination of internal and external links. You may create an unlimited number of additional menus, each of which will automatically have an associated block (if you have the <a href="!block_help">Block module</a> installed). By selecting <em>Edit menu</em>, you can add, edit, or delete links for a given menu. The links listing page provides a drag-and-drop interface for controlling the order of links, and creating a hierarchy within the menu.
If you have the Block module enabled, then each menu that you create is rendered in a block that you enable and position on the <a href="!blocks">Block layout page</a>. In some <a href="!themes">themes</a>, the main menu and possibly the secondary menu will be output automatically; you may be able to disable this behavior on the <a href="!themes">theme's settings page</a>.
You can enable the newly-created block for this menu on the <a href="!blocks">Block layout page</a>.
Each menu has a corresponding block that is managed on the <a href="!blocks">Block layout page</a>.
The content access permissions need to be rebuilt. <a href="@node_access_rebuild">Rebuild permissions</a>.
The Node module manages the creation, editing, deletion, settings, and display of the main site content. Content items managed by the Node module are typically displayed as pages on your site, and include a title, some meta-data (author, creation time, content type, etc.), and optional fields containing text or other data (fields are managed by the <a href="!field">Field module</a>). For more information, see <a href="!node">the online documentation for the Node module</a>.
When new content is created, the Node module records basic information about the content, including the author, date of creation, and the <a href="!content-type">Content type</a>. It also manages the <em>publishing options</em>, which define whether or not the content is published, promoted to the front page of the site, and/or sticky at the top of content lists. Default settings can be configured for each <a href="!content-type">type of content</a> on your site.
The Node module makes a number of permissions available for each content type, which can be set by role on the <a href="!permissions">permissions page</a>.
The Options module allows you to create fields where data values are selected from a fixed list of options. Usually these items are entered through a select list, checkboxes, or radio buttons. See the <a href="!field">Field module help</a> and the <a href="!field_ui">Field UI help</a> pages for general information on fields and how to create and manage them. For more information, see the <a href="!options_do">online documentation for the Options module</a>.
The <em>settings</em> and the <em>display</em> of the list fields can be configured separately. See the <a href="!field_ui">Field UI help</a> for more information on how to manage fields and their display.
The Path module provides a way to search and view a <a href="!aliases">list of all aliases</a> that are in use on your website. Aliases can be added, edited and deleted through this list.
This module does not have a user interface. It is used by other modules which need to serialize data, such as <a href="!rest">REST</a>.
For more information, see the <a href="!doc_url">online documentation for the Serialization module</a>.
Users with the <em>Administer shortcuts</em> permission can manage shortcut sets and edit the shortcuts within sets from the <a href="!shortcuts">Shortcuts administration page</a>.
Define which shortcut set you are using on the <a href="@shortcut-link">Shortcuts tab</a> of your account page.
The Testing module provides a framework for running automated tests. It can be used to verify a working state of Drupal before and after any code changes, or as a means for developers to write and execute tests for their modules. For more information, see <a href="!simpletest">the online documentation for the Testing module</a>.
Visit the <a href="!admin-simpletest">Testing page</a> to display a list of available tests. For comprehensive testing, select <em>all</em> tests, or individually select tests for more targeted testing. Note that it might take several minutes for all tests to complete.
The Statistics module shows you how often content is viewed. This is useful in determining which pages of your site are most popular. For more information, see <a href="!statistics_do">the online documentation for the Statistics module</a>.
The Syslog module logs events by sending messages to the logging facility of your web server's operating system. Syslog is an operating system administrative logging tool that provides valuable information for use in system management and security auditing. Most suited to medium and large sites, Syslog provides filtering tools that allow messages to be routed by type and severity. For more information, see the <a href='!syslog'>online documentation for the Syslog module</a>, as well as PHP's documentation pages for the <a href='!php_openlog'>openlog</a> and <a href='!php_syslog'>syslog</a> functions.
The Telephone module allows you to create fields that contain telephone numbers. See the <a href="!field">Field module help</a> and the <a href="!field_ui">Field UI help</a> pages for general information on fields and how to create and manage them. For more information, see the <a href="!telephone_documentation">online documentation for the Telephone module</a>.
The <em>settings</em> and the <em>display</em> of the telephone field can be configured separately. See the <a href="!field_ui">Field UI help</a> for more information on how to manage fields and their display.
The Text module allows you to create short and long text fields with optional summaries. See the <a href="!field">Field module help</a> and the <a href="!field_ui">Field UI help</a> pages for general information on fields and how to create and manage them. For more information, see the <a href="!text_documentation">online documentation for the Text module</a>.
The <em>settings</em> and <em>display</em> of the text field can be configured separately. See the <a href="!field_ui">Field UI help</a> for more information on how to manage fields and their display.
The Tour module provides users with guided tours of the site interface. Each tour consists of several tips that highlight elements of the user interface, guide the user through a workflow, or explain key concepts of the website. For more information, see <a href='!tour'>the online documentation for the Tour module</a>.
Tours can be written as YAML-documents with a text editor, or using the contributed <a href='!tour_ui'>Tour UI</a> module. For more information, see <a href='!doc_url'>the online documentation for writing tours</a>.
The User module allows users to register, log in, and log out. It also allows users with proper permissions to manage user roles and permissions. For more information, see the <a href="!user_docs">online documentation for the User module</a>.
For more information, see the <a href="!views">online documentation for the Views module</a>.
In order to create and modify your own views using the administration and configuration user interface, you will need to enable either the Views UI module in core or a contributed module that provides a user interface for Views. See the <a href="!views-ui">Views UI module help page</a> for more information.
Contributed projects that support the Views module can be found in the <a href="!node">online documentation for Views-related contributed modules</a>.
The Views UI module provides an interface for managing views for the <a href="@views">Views module</a>. For more information, see the <a href="@handbook">online documentation for the Views UI module</a>.
Views can be created from the <a href="@list">Views list page</a> by using the "Add new view" action. Existing views can be managed from the <a href="@list">Views list page</a> by locating the view in the "Enabled" or "Disabled" list and selecting the desired operation action, for example "Edit".
Views can be enabled or disabled from the <a href="@list">Views list page</a>. To enable a view, find the view within the "Disabled" list and select the "Enable" operation. To disable a view find the view within the "Enabled" list and select the "Disable" operation.
Views can be exported and imported as configuration files by using the <a href="@config">Configuration Manager module</a>.
