The Aggregator module is an on-site syndicator and news reader that gathers and displays fresh content from RSS-, RDF-, and Atom-based feeds made available across the web. Thousands of sites (particularly news sites and blogs) publish their latest headlines in feeds, using a number of standardized XML-based formats. For more information, see the <a href="!aggregator-module">online documentation for the Aggregator module</a>.
Users view feed content in the <a href="!aggregator">main aggregator display</a>, or by <a href="!aggregator-sources">their source</a> (usually via an RSS feed reader). The most recent content in a feed can be displayed as a block through the <a href="!admin-block">Blocks administration page</a>.
A <a href="!aggregator-opml">machine-readable OPML file</a> of all feeds is available. OPML is an XML-based file format used to share outline-structured information such as a list of RSS feeds. Feeds can also be <a href="!import-opml">imported via an OPML file</a>.
The Ban module allows administrators to ban visits to their site from individual IP addresses. For more information, see <a href="!url">the online documentation for the Ban module</a>.
Administrators can enter IP addresses to ban on the <a href="!bans">IP address bans</a> page.
