The Actions module provides tasks that can be executed by the site such as unpublishing content, sending email messages, or blocking a user. Other modules can trigger these actions when specific system events happen; for example, when new content is posted or when a user logs in. Modules can also provide additional actions. For more information, see the <a href="!documentation">online documentation for the Action module</a>.
<em>Simple actions</em> do not require configuration and are listed automatically as available on the <a href="!actions">Actions page</a>.
<em>Advanced actions</em> are user-created and have to be configured individually. Create an advanced action on the <a href="!actions">Actions page</a> by selecting an action type from the drop-down list. Then configure your action, for example by specifying the recipient of an automated email message.
A working <a href="!cron">cron maintenance task</a> is required to update feeds automatically.
The Ban module allows administrators to ban visits to their site from individual IP addresses. For more information, see <a href="!url">the online documentation for the Ban module</a>.
Administrators can enter IP addresses to ban on the <a href="!bans">IP address bans</a> page.
The Block module allows you to place blocks in regions of your installed themes, and configure block settings. For more information, see the <a href="!blocks-documentation">online documentation for the Block module</a>.
You can add custom blocks, if the <em>Custom Block</em> module is installed. For more information, see the <a href="!blockcontent-help">Custom Block help page</a>.
The Custom Block module allows you to create custom <em>block types</em> and <em>content-containing blocks</em>, and provides a <a href="!block-library">Custom block library</a> listing all of them. Custom block types have fields; see the <a href="!field-help">Field module help</a> for more information. Once created, custom blocks can be placed in regions just like blocks provided by other modules; see the <a href="!blocks">Block module help page</a> for details. For more information, see <a href="!online-help">the online documentation for the Custom Block module</a>.
Blocks in the block library belong to <a href="!types">block types</a>, each with its own fields and display settings. After creating a block, place it in a region from the <a href="!blocks">Block layout page</a>.
Each block type has its own fields and display settings. Create blocks of each type on the <a href="!block-library">Block library page</a>.
In order to translate configuration, the website must have at least two <a href="!url">languages</a>.
Users with the <em>Translate user edited configuration</em> permission can access the configuration translation overview, and manage translations for specific languages. The <a href="!translation-page">Configuration translation</a> page shows a list of all configuration text that can be translated, either as individual items or as lists. After you click on <em>Translate</em>, you are provided with a list of all languages. You can <em>add</em> or <em>edit</em> a translation for a specific language. Users with specific configuration permissions can also <em>edit</em> the text for the site's default language. For some configuration text items (for example for the site information), the specific translation pages can also be accessed directly from their configuration pages.
On the <a href="!contact_admin">Contact forms page</a>, you can configure the fields and display of the personal contact form, and you can set up one or more site-wide contact forms. Each site-wide contact form has a machine name, a label, and one or more defined recipients; when a site visitor submits the form, the field values are sent to those recipients.
The Database Logging module logs system events in the Drupal database. For more information, see the online handbook entry for the <a href="!dblog">Database Logging module</a>.
The Database Logging module allows you to view an event log on the <a href="!dblog">Recent log messages</a> page. The log is a chronological list of recorded events containing usage data, performance data, errors, warnings and operational information. Administrators should check the log on a regular basis to ensure their site is working properly.
There are two reports available that list the fields defined on your site. The <a href="!entity-list" title="Entities field list report">Entities</a> report lists all your fields, showing the field machine names, types, and the entity types or sub-types they are used on (each sub-type links to the Manage fields page). If the <a href="!views">Views</a> and <a href="!views-ui">Views UI</a> modules are enabled, the <a href="!views-list" title="Used in views field list report">Used in views</a> report lists each field that is used in a view, with a link to edit that view.
<strong>Configure your website</strong> Once logged in, visit the <a href="!admin">Administration page</a>, where you may <a href="!config">customize and configure</a> all aspects of your website.
<strong>Enable additional functionality</strong> Next, visit the <a href="!modules">Extend page</a> and enable modules that suit your specific needs. You can find additional modules at the <a href="!download_modules">Drupal.org modules page</a>.
<strong>Customize your website design</strong> To change the "look and feel" of your website, visit the <a href="!themes">Appearance page</a>. You may choose from one of the included themes or download additional themes from the <a href="!download_themes">Drupal.org themes page</a>.
<strong>Start posting content</strong> Finally, you may <a href="!content">add new content</a> to your website.
For more information, refer to the subjects listed in the Help Topics section or to the <a href="!docs">online documentation</a> and <a href="!support">support</a> pages at <a href="!drupal">drupal.org</a>.
Define how to decide which language is used to display page elements (primarily text provided by modules, such as field labels and help text). This decision is made by evaluating a series of detection methods for languages; the first detection method that gets a result will determine which language is used for that type of text. Be aware that some language detection methods are unreliable under certain conditions, such as browser detection when page-caching is enabled and a user is not currently logged in. Define the order of evaluation of language detection methods on this page. The default language can be changed in the <a href="!admin-change-language">list of languages</a>.
The Interface Translation module allows you to translate interface text (<em>strings</em>) into different languages, and to switch between them for the display of interface text. It uses the functionality provided by the <a href="!language">Language module</a>. For more information, see the <a href="!doc-url">online documentation for the Interface Translation module</a>.
You can translate individual strings directly on the <a href="!translate">User interface translation</a> page, or download the currently-used translation file for a specific language on the <a title="User interface translation export" href="!export">Export</a> page. Once you have edited the translation file, you can then import it again on the <a title="User interface translation import" href="!import">Import</a> page.
Interface translations are automatically imported when a language is added, or when new modules or themes are enabled. The report <a href="!update">Available translation updates</a> shows the status. Interface text can be customized in the <a href="!translate">user interface translation</a> page.
This page allows a translator to search for specific translated and untranslated strings, and is used when creating or editing translations. (Note: Because translation tasks involve many strings, it may be more convenient to <a title="User interface translation export" href="!export">export</a> strings for offline editing in a desktop Gettext translation editor.) Searches may be limited to strings in a specific language.
Translation files are automatically downloaded and imported when <a title="Languages" href="!language">languages</a> are added, or when modules or themes are enabled.
This page allows translators to manually import translated strings contained in a Gettext Portable Object (.po) file. Manual import may be used for customized translations or for the translation of custom modules and themes. To customize translations you can download a translation file from the <a href="!url">Drupal translation server</a> or <a title="User interface translation export" href="!export">export</a> translations from the site, customize the translations using a Gettext translation editor, and import the result using this page.
Each menu has a corresponding block that is managed on the <a href="!blocks">Block layout page</a>.
The Migrate module provides a framework for migrating data, usually from an external source into your site. It does not provide a user interface. For more information, see the <a href="!migrate">online documentation for the Migrate module</a>.
The Migrate Drupal module provides a framework based on the <a href="!migrate">Migrate module</a> to facilitate migration from a Drupal (6, 7, or 8) site to your website. It does not provide a user interface. For more information, see the <a href="!migrate_drupal">online documentation for the Migrate Drupal module</a>.
The Node module gives users with the <em>Administer content types</em> permission the ability to <a href="!content-new">create new content types</a> in addition to the default ones already configured. Creating custom content types gives you the flexibility to add <a href="!field">fields</a> and configure default settings that suit the differing needs of various site content.
The <a href="!content">Content</a> page lists your content, allowing you add new content, filter, edit or delete existing content, or perform bulk operations on existing content.
The Internal Page Cache module caches pages for anonymous users in the database. For more information, see the <a href="!pagecache-documentation">online documentation for the Internal Page Cache module</a>.
The Quick Edit module allows users with the <a href="!quickedit_permission">Access in-place editing</a> and <a href="!contextual_permission">Use contextual links</a> permissions to edit field content without visiting a separate page. For more information, see the <a href="!handbook_url">online documentation for the Quick Edit module</a>.
The RDF module enriches your content with metadata to let other applications (e.g., search engines, aggregators, and so on) better understand its relationships and attributes. This semantically enriched, machine-readable output for your website uses the <a href="!rdfa">RDFa specification</a>, which allows RDF data to be embedded in HTML markup. Other modules can define mappings of their data to RDF terms, and the RDF module makes this RDF data available to the theme. The core modules define RDF mappings for their data model, and the core themes output this RDF metadata information along with the human-readable visual information. For more information, see the <a href="!rdf">online documentation for the RDF module</a>.
To configure search pages, visit the <a href="!search-settings">Search pages page</a>. In the Search pages section, you can add a new search page, edit the configuration of existing search pages, enable and disable search pages, and choose the default search page. Each enabled search page has a URL path starting with <em>search</em>, and each will appear as a tab or local task link on the <a href="!search-url">search page</a>; you can configure the text that is shown in the tab. In addition, some search page plugins have additional settings that you can configure for each search page.
Some search page plugins, such as the core Content search page, index searchable text using the Drupal core search index, and will not work unless content is indexed. Indexing is done during <em>cron</em> runs, so it requires a <a href="!cron">cron maintenance task</a> to be set up. There are also several settings affecting indexing that can be configured on the <a href="!search-settings">Search pages page</a>: the number of items to index per cron run, the minimum word length to index, and how to handle Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters.
Modules providing search page plugins generally ensure that content-related actions on your site (creating, editing, or deleting content and comments) automatically cause affected content items to be marked for indexing or reindexing at the next cron run. When content is marked for reindexing, the previous content remains in the index until cron runs, at which time it is replaced by the new content. However, there are some actions related to the structure of your site that do not cause affected content to be marked for reindexing. Examples of structure-related actions that affect content include deleting or editing taxonomy terms, enabling or disabling modules that add text to content (such as Taxonomy, Comment, and field-providing modules), and modifying the fields or display parameters of your content types. If you take one of these actions and you want to ensure that the search index is updated to reflect your changed site structure, you can mark all content for reindexing by clicking the "Re-index site" button on the <a href="!search-settings">Search pages page</a>. If you have a lot of content on your site, it may take several cron runs for the content to be reindexed.
The search engine maintains an index of words found in your site's content. To build and maintain this index, a correctly configured <a href="!cron">cron maintenance task</a> is required. Indexing behavior can be adjusted using the settings below.
The Shortcut module allows users to create sets of <em>shortcut</em> links to commonly-visited pages of the site. Shortcuts are contained within <em>sets</em>. Each user with <em>Select any shortcut set</em> permission can select a shortcut set created by anyone at the site. For more information, see the <a href="!shortcut">online documentation for the Shortcut module</a>.
You can display your shortcuts by enabling the <em>Shortcuts</em> block on the <a href="!blocks">Blocks administration page</a>. Certain administrative modules also display your shortcuts; for example, the core <a href="!toolbar-help">Toolbar module</a> provides a corresponding menu item.
The module includes a <em>Popular content</em> block that displays the most viewed pages today and for all time, and the last content viewed. To use the block, enable <em>Count content views</em> on the <a href="!statistics-settings">Statistics page</a>, and then you can enable and configure the block on the <a href="!blocks">Block layout page</a>.
The Statistics module includes a counter for each page that increases whenever the page is viewed. To use the counter, enable <em>Count content views</em> on the <a href="!statistics-settings">Statistics page</a>, and set the necessary <a href="!permissions">permissions</a> (<em>View content hits</em>) so that the counter is visible to the users.
On the <a href="!toolkit">Image toolkit page</a>, you can select and configure the PHP toolkit used to manipulate images. Depending on which distribution or installation profile you choose when you install your site, the GD2 toolkit and possibly others are included; other toolkits may be provided by contributed modules.
Download additional <a href="!modules">contributed modules</a> to extend your site's functionality.
Regularly review available updates to maintain a secure and current site. Always run the <a href="!update-php">update script</a> each time a module is updated. Enable the <a href="!update-manager">Update Manager module</a> to update and install modules and themes.
Here you can find a short overview of your site's parameters as well as any problems detected with your installation. It may be useful to copy and paste this information into support requests filed on Drupal.org's support forums and project issue queues. Before filing a support request, ensure that your web server meets the <a href="!system-requirements">system requirements.</a>
The Taxonomy module allows users who have permission to create and edit content to categorize (tag) content of that type. Users who have the <em>Administer vocabularies and terms</em> <a href="!permissions" title="Taxonomy module permissions">permission</a> can add <em>vocabularies</em> that contain a set of related <em>terms</em>. The terms in a vocabulary can either be pre-set by an administrator or built gradually as content is added and edited. Terms may be organized hierarchically if desired.
For more information, see the <a href="!taxonomy">online documentation for the Taxonomy module</a>.
See the <a href="!entity_reference">Entity Reference help</a> page for the field widgets and formatters that can be configured for any reference field on the <em>Manage display</em> and <em>Manage form display</em> pages. Taxonomy additionally provides an <em>RSS category</em> formatter that displays nothing when the entity item is displayed as HTML, but displays an RSS category instead of a list when the entity item is displayed in an RSS feed.
If you choose <em>Text (plain)</em> or <em>Text (plain, long)</em> you restrict the input to <em>Plain text</em> only. If you choose <em>Text (formatted)</em>, <em>Text (formatted, long)</em>, or <em>Text (formatted, long with summary)</em> you allow users to write formatted text. Which options are available to individual users depends on the settings on the <a href="!formats">Text formats and editors page</a>.
The Tour module provides users with guided tours of the site interface. Each tour consists of several tips that highlight elements of the user interface, guide the user through a workflow, or explain key concepts of the website. For more information, see <a href='!tour'>the online documentation for the Tour module</a>.
The Activity Tracker module displays the most recently added and updated content on your site, and allows you to follow new content created by each user. This module has no configuration options. For more information, see the <a href="!tracker">online documentation for the Tracker module</a>.
The <a href="!recent">Recent content</a> page shows new and updated content in reverse chronological order, listing the content type, title, author's name, number of comments, and time of last update. Content is considered updated when changes occur in the text, or when new comments are added. The <em>My recent content</em> tab limits the list to the currently logged-in user.
The Update Manager module periodically checks for new versions of your site's software (including contributed modules and themes), and alerts administrators to available updates. The Update Manager system is also used by some other modules to manage updates and downloads; for example, the Interface Translation module uses the Update Manager to download translations from the localization server. Note that whenever the Update Manager system is used, anonymous usage statistics are sent to Drupal.org. If desired, you may disable the Update Manager module from the <a href="!modules">Extend page</a>; if you do so, functionality that depends on the Update Manager system will not work. For more information, see <a href="!update">the online documentation for the Update Manager module</a>.
The <a href="!update-report">Available updates report</a> displays core, contributed modules, and themes for which there are new releases available for download. On the report page, you can also check manually for updates. You can configure the frequency of update checks, which are performed during cron runs, and whether notifications are sent on the <a href="!update-settings">Update Manager settings page</a>.
The Update Manager module allows administrators to perform updates directly from the <a href="!update-page">Update page</a>. It lists all available updates, and you can confirm whether you want to download them. If you don't have sufficient access rights to your web server, you could be prompted for your FTP/SSH password. Afterwards the files are transferred into your site installation, overwriting your old files. Direct links to the Update page are also displayed on the <a href="!modules_page">Extend page</a> and the <a href="!themes_page">Appearance page</a>.
You can also install new modules and themes in the same fashion, through the <a href="!install">Install page</a>, or by clicking the <em>Install new module/theme</em> links at the top of the <a href="!modules_page">Extend page</a> and the <a href="!themes_page">Appearance page</a>. In this case, you are prompted to provide either the URL to the download, or to upload a packaged release file from your local computer.
The <a href="!accounts">Account settings page</a> allows you to manage settings for the displayed name of the Anonymous user role, personal contact forms, user registration settings, and account cancellation settings. On this page you can also manage settings for account personalization, and adapt the text for the email messages that users receive when they register or request a password recovery. You may also set which role is automatically assigned new permissions whenever a module is enabled (the Administrator role).
Permissions let you control what users can do and see on your site. You can define a specific set of permissions for each role. (See the <a href="!role">Roles</a> page to create a role.) Any permissions granted to the Authenticated user role will be given to any user who is logged in to your site. From the <a href="!settings">Account settings</a> page, you can make any role into an Administrator role for the site, meaning that role will be granted all new permissions automatically. You should be careful to ensure that only trusted users are given this access and level of control of your site.
